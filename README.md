# Minimal Youtube

A Chrome extension to declutter YouTube and stop the rabbit hole.

Sometimes I get stuck a couple of hours in Youtube because the algorithm is too good and I find myself opening recommended videos in new tabs, here is my solution to stop doing that.

You can hide the following sections from your Youtube page

* Recommended videos
* Comments
* Metadata (buttons, channel name, view, etc...)

So you can change from this view

<img src="./images/before.png" width=400>

To this one

<img src="./images/after.png" width=400>

And stop doom scrolling (or whatever is equivalent in PC) to get some stuff done.

## Installation

You can install directly from the chrome extension's store [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/minimal-youtube/emcnocggodlgmhjjocdbeooooaakjfcp).
