# Minimal Youtube

Sometimes I get stuck a couple of hours in Youtube because the algorithm it's too good and I find myself opening recommended videos in new tabs, here is my solution to stop doing that.

It allows you can hide the following sections from your Youtube page

* Recommended videos
* Comments
* Metadata (Interactive buttons, channel name, view, etc...)

So you can change from this view

<img src="./images/before.png" width=200>

To this one

<img src="./images/after.png" width=200>

And stop doom scrolling (or whatever is equivalent in PC) to get some stuff done.

## Installation
